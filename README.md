This is Basic Linux Guide — your quick-start resource to navigating and using Linux effectively as a beginner!

## 🔧 What is Linux?
Linux is a family of open-source, Unix-like operating systems built around the Linux kernel

## 🖥️ Linux Distros
- Ubuntu 
- Arch Linux
- CentOS
- Red Hat
- Parrot OS
- Peppermint OS

## 💻 What is terminal?
It's a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands
Also known as **command line interface or CLI**

> Tips:
- Start the terminal by pressing `ctrl + ALT + T`
- Use `TAB` to autocomplete directory/file names
- use the `↑` to access previous commands

## 📁 File Directory Management

Here's how to navigate and manage files/folders from the terminal:

- `ls`
Lists the contents of a directory, such as files and subdirectories.

```bash
ls -l # Long listing format
ls -a # Shows hidden files
ls -lh # Lists in human readable format
```

- `pwd`
Prints the full path of the current working directory.

- `cd`
Changes the current directory to a different one specified by the user.

- `mkdir`
Creates a new directory or folder.

```bash
mkkdir <directory_path>
mkdir -p <directory path> # Create parent directory
```

- `mv`
Moves files or directories from one location to another. It can also be used to rename files or directories.
```bash
mv file.txt /Desktop/Documents # Move file
mv file.txt lucy.txt # Rename file
```

- `cp`
Copies files or directories from one location to another, while leaving a copy of the same file. 
```bash
cp file.txt /desktop # Copying to another destination
```

- `rm`
Removes or deletes files and directories from the file system.
```bash
rm file.txt # Deletes a file
rm -r lucy # Deletes a directory and its contents recursively
rm -i file.txt # Prompts before deletion
```

- `touch`
Creates an empty file with the specified name. It can also be used to update the timestamp of existing files.

```bash
touch new_file.txt
```

- `clear`
Clears all previous output on the terminal screen, giving a clean slate for new commands.

## 📁 Viewing and Editing Files

This section introduces commands used to view, edit, and understand file contents in the terminal.

- `cat`
Displays the contents of a file directly in the terminal. 

> It reads the file from beginning to end and outputs the content.

Prints text to the terminal.

```bash
echo "Hello world!"
echo "It's a new day!" > new_file.txt # Writes the text into the new_file.txt file
```

- `less`
Allows scrolling through the contents of a file one page at a time.

> Use spacebar to move forward, q to quit

- `head`
Displays the first few lines of a file.

- `tail`
Shows the last few lines of a file.

- `sort`
Arranges lines of a file or input in a specific order, usually alphabetically or numerically.

## 🧾 File Comparison

These commands are used for comparing files and directories

- `diff`
Compares two text files line by line and highlights differences.
```bash

Finds files and directories by name using a pre-built index (database of all file paths on your system).
```bash
locate *.py
```

- `whereis`
Displays the location of the binary, source and manual files for a given command. It helps locate where software is installed.

- `which`
Similar to `whereis`, but only shows one file path

## File Permissions & Ownership

### A. Changing permissions
The `chmod` command in Unix-like operating systems is used to change the access permissions of files and directories. It allows you to control who can read, write, and execute (or search in the case of directories) files or directories. The name "chmod" is short for "change mode". 

Here are symbolic notations that can be used together with `chmod`:
- u: User (owner)
- g: Group
- o: Others 
- +: Add permission
- -: Remove permission
- =: Set permission exactly 
- r: Read
- w: Write
- x: Execute.

Here are some of the numeric notations that can be used to grant permissions:
- 4: Read
- 2: Write
- 1: Execute 
- 0: No permission

The numbers are combined to represent combined permissions (e.g., 7 is 4+2+1 which means a combination of read, write, and execute permissions)

> NOTE: Be very careful when running `chmod 777` as this give read, write and execute permissions to all users.

Example usage:

```bash
chmod u+x <filename> #Adds execute permission for the owner of the file.

chmod g-r <filename> # Removes read permission for the group of the file.

chmod 755 <filename> #Sets permissions to rwxr-xr-x (owner can read, write, and execute; group and others can read and execute).

chmod 644 <filename> #Sets permissions to rw-r--r-- (owner can read and write; group and others can read only).
```
### B. Changing Ownership

The chown command in Unix-like operating systems is used to change the owner and group of files and directories. It's a crucial command for managing file permissions and access control. The basic syntax is chown [options] owner[:group] file(s), where owner can be a user name or user ID, and group can be a group name or group ID.

Example usage:

```bash
chown john:users example.txt
chown -R jane:developers directory_name
```

> NOTE: ONLY the superuser (root) or a user with appropriate privileges can change the ownership of a file or directory.
